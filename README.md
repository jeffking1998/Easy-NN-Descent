# NN-Descent
A NN-Descent implementation in Python. This a strightforward version without any tricks for large dataset.
This is a toy implementation for my assignment, which is required to write in C++. 

There is a well-designed version of NN-Descent called [pynndescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent). But I present here is a strightforward implementation for ones who are new to this algorithm.
